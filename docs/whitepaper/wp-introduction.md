<p>The QURAS Blockchain has been developed to promote the confidentiality of a user by promoting encryption on a coin or sending and receiving of coins and by fostering the encryption of a widely used Smart Contract to the storage space of a widely used Smart contract.</p>
<p>Although many articles and blockchains associated with current anonymous transactions of the blockchain have emerged, the QURAS Blockchain feature has been developed to provide a Platform that allows users to store their private information in the blockchain by encrypting coin transactions, encrypting the storage space for a smart contract, and diversifying encryption.</p>
<p>QURAS teams also have deepened research on the blockchain encryption, continuing to update the encryption portion of the blockchain to ensure that users can secure more safe areas.</p>
<p>At present, the QURAS team implemented ZK-SNARKS algorithm, which has been implemented with ZCASH coin, to realize anonymization of coin transmission and reception, to improve the problem of speed which is a defect of ZK-SNARKS algorithm in future and to make the convenience of users.</p>
<p>We have also studied Ring Signature and are investigating the possibility of using coin transmission encryption and the coupling method for it.</p>
<p>We intend to advance research and development of ZK-SNARKS and Ring Signature with the aim of realizing encryption of the coin.</p>
<p>QURAS Blockchain, through various exchanges of opinions with users, has been developing the content raised by users as SMART CONTRACT, and has focused on enabling users to embody a more diverse service on a blockchain.</p>
<p>Other than that, QURAS Blockchain has been focusing its efforts on providing faster processing speeds for users by overcoming defects such as maximizing in blockchains, such as bitcoin and ZCASH using a DBFT agreement algorithm.</p>
<p>The QURAS team has deepened research on the possibility of binding to the Internet of Things (IoT) and is proceeding with the concept of DAG that will be introduced into the 3.0 versions of the blockchain.</p>
<p>We have studied the possibility of combining future IOT and QURAS Blockchain with the aim of its development.</p>
